# Tetris
Tetris is a tile-matching video game where players rotate and arrange falling geometric shapes, called tetrominoes, to form complete, gapless horizontal lines within a rectangular playing field. When a line is formed, it disappears, and the blocks above fall down, allowing the player to score points and continue playing.
